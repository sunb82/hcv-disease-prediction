                HCV DISEASE PREDICTION PROJECT - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY REPORT
======================================================================================
Project: Machine Learning System for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Disease Stage Prediction

======================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict different stages of 
Hepatitis C disease progression using clinical blood test data. The model will classify 
patients into one of five categories:
  1. Blood Donor (healthy)
  2. Suspect Blood Donor
  3. Hepatitis
  4. Fibrosis
  5. Cirrhosis

DATASET CHARACTERISTICS
-----------------------
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (HCV dataset)
Total Samples: 615 patients
Features: 13 clinical measurements + 1 target variable
  - Demographics: Age, Sex
  - Liver Enzymes: ALT, AST, ALP, GGT
  - Other Biomarkers: Albumin, Bilirubin, Cholinesterase, Cholesterol, Creatinine, Total Protein

     - Validation: 118 samples
     - Test: 118 samples
   
   • Feature scaling:
